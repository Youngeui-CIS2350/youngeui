COURSEWORK OVERVIEW
Students are expected to stay up to date with the course materials and graded activities.  Not getting behind is critical to learning and success in this course.  
QUIZZES
In this course, quizzes will serve as a valuable tool to assess your understanding of the material and track your progress throughout the semester. You will take quizzes in the beginning of classes, and the quizzes will be administered periodically (see the course outline) and will cover topics discussed in class or assigned readings. Specific details regarding quiz dates, format, and content will be provided in the course schedule and through announcements in AsULearn.
LABS (DISCUSSIONS AND ACTIVITIES)
Lab discussions and activities will vary from performing data set analysis, working with machine learning and artificial intelligence programs, text and image analytics, and other AI and cybersecurity related platforms. These lab sessions are not meant for students to show mastery of programs or analysis, but to allow students the opportunity to gain insight to the implementation on AI, machine learning, and cybersecurity. Details will be given throughout the semester via AsULearn. 
GROUP PROJECT REPORT AND PRESENTATION
You will be divided into groups (size is TBD based on number of students) in which you will work through a group project concerning AI. Your team can propose a new business idea (like start-up) or do business case studies (e.g., analyzing data using AI). More details will be provided via AsULearn (and in class). 
(Oral presentations can be an effective to assess your competency on topics. An advantage to this approach is that students can learn from each other and build on your knowledge simultaneously. This type of assessment will also foster career-ready skills such as collaboration, leading a presentation and brainstorming with teammates.)

SYLLABUS POLICIES
This course will be conducted in accordance with Appalachian State University’s Syllabi Policy and Statement found at the following link: https://academicaffairs.appstate.edu/resources/syllabi-policy-and-statement-information

Please note, this includes policies related to
1.	Academic Integrity
2.	Disability Resources
3.	Attendance Policy; Acceptable Student Absences from Class
4.	Student Engagement


COURSE POLICIES
This course has the following supplemental policies specific to this course extending the Syllabus policies above. https://academicaffairs.appstate.edu/resources-forms/syllabi-policy-and-statement-information 

Academic Integrity Code: Students attending App State agree to abide by the following code (1) Students will not lie, cheat, or steal to gain academic advantage. (2) Students will oppose every instance of academic dishonesty. Students shall agree to abide by the Academic Integrity Code.
Disability Resources: App State is committed to providing an inclusive experience, accessible learning environments and equal opportunity to individuals with disabilities in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Individuals needing reasonable accommodations should contact the Office of Disability Resources (828.262.3056 or odr.appstate.edu).
Student Engagement: In its mission statement, Appalachian State University aims at "providing undergraduate students a rigorous liberal education that emphasizes transferable skills and preparation for professional careers" as well as "maintaining a faculty whose members serve as excellent teachers and scholarly mentors for their students." Such rigor means that the foremost activity of Appalachian students is an intense engagement with their courses. In practical terms, students should expect to spend two to three hours of studying for every hour of class time. Hence, a fifteen-hour academic load might reasonably require between 30 and 45 hours per week of out-of-class work.
Make-up Policy and Late Work: By the nature of this class structure, late work will not be accepted. This includes all graded activities (e.g., exams, quizzes, assignments). Our course schedule will move quickly, so I encourage you to complete all graded activities on time.
It is your responsibility to begin graded activities early enough before their due date so that you can overcome any technological hurdles that may come between you and turning in your work fully completed and on time. These hurdles include but are not limited to; local PC problems, Internet connectivity problems, AsULearn connectivity, failure to obtain the material in time, etc.
Any uncoordinated unexcused graded activities result in a score of 0. No exceptions will be made unless there is a documented emergency or University documented and approved excuse that prevents participation at the scheduled times. Students missing graded activities (e.g., exams, quizzes, assignments) because of a university supported function (e.g., team travel) or other excused absence can make-up the work if arrangements are made at least one week prior to the due date of the activity. Make-up work will need to be completed within 48 hours of the activity’s original due date and only verified official excuses will be accepted. 
Extensions or exceptions to this policy will only be granted when unusual and unavoidable circumstances beyond your control occur. The judgment regarding if work can be turned in late for full or partial credit is at the sole judgment of the instructor. Documentation will be required to support any requests for an exception to these policies.
Classroom Etiquette and Professionalism: As a courtesy to others, please silence all electronic devices during class.  Please do not use computers during class for extra-curricular activities.  Please refrain from arriving to class late, departing class early and exiting/entering class at your leisure as these actions are considered poor classroom etiquette.
You must attend class and participate fully in-class activities. Each absence, or act of unprofessional conduct (including, but not limited to tardiness, sleeping in class, leaving/packing up early, wireless phone ringing, social media phubbing, etc.) will be noted.
You are expected to achieve course expectations by exhibiting the knowledge you have gained on course topics, do your fair share of work, and collaborate within teams, keep up with the assigned schedule, and approach this course in a professional manner. You will soon be entering a professional workplace.  Your work ethic and behavior towards this class should be appropriate for that environment.
Attendance Policy: Class attendance is mandatory. If you feel that you will be unavailable over key portions of the course, please communicate with your instructor in least 48 hours or more in advance for any days you plan to miss. This includes excusable absences due to a university supported function (e.g., team travel), a private occurrence (e.g., death of a family member) verified through the dean of students, or if an absence is confirmed through me via email at least one week in advance of missing class. Students are responsible for collecting all appropriate notes from their peers for all days missed. Students with 3 unexcused absences will receive a failing grade in the course. Any students who show up 30 minutes after class begins are officially absent, resulting in no credit for attendance.
Grade Challenges: If a student would like to challenge their grade on completed work and/or exams, the ‘entire’ work will be reviewed. This may result in a net loss of points even if the problem motivating the challenge is correct. If a student challenges graded work more than twice without a change of grade, future challenges may be refused or require involvement of an intermediary at discretion of the instructor.
